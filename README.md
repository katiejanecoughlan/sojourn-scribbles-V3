# UX

## Database Planning

I used Lucidchart to create my database entity relationship diagrams. Below you can see how each model relates to eachother.  
I have included the About model for visibility sake eventhough it does not directly relate to anything else (user does not have to be logged in to view the content/submit the form on that page).  
While I used the default Django User setup and it is not a custom model, it is included in the diagram for clarity sake.

## UX Design

### Overview
Sojourn Scribbles is envisioned as a modern, vibrant, and inclusive platform tailored specifically for solo female travelers. The UX design focuses on creating an engaging and welcoming environment that reflects the spirit of exploration and camaraderie. With a fun and feminine aesthetic, the site aims to foster connections, inspire wanderlust, and celebrate the diverse experiences of solo female travelers.

### Site User
The primary users of Sojourn Scribbles are solo female travelers from diverse backgrounds and ages, each with their own unique travel stories and perspectives. These users seek a supportive and inclusive community where they can share their adventures, seek advice, and connect with others who share their passion for exploration. They value authenticity, empathy, and the opportunity to engage with like-minded individuals in a safe and welcoming space.

### Goal
Sojourn Scribbles aims to empower solo female travelers by providing a platform where they can share their experiences, find inspiration for future trips, and build meaningful connections with fellow adventurers. Through authentic storytelling, travel tips, and community engagement, the site strives to create a supportive environment where users feel encouraged to share their stories, seek advice, and support one another in their journeys. The goal is to cultivate a vibrant and inclusive community that celebrates the strength, resilience, and spirit of solo female travelers, while also providing valuable resources and inspiration for their adventures.


## Wireframes

I used Balsamiq to create my wireframes. The final product looks a bit different to original intentions but served as a good guide nonetheless. The wireframes contain a lot of detail about the future vision and long term plan for Sojourn Scribbes with future features. These features were not possible due to the scope of the current project for the time contrainsts given. 

![Plan overview](/static/images/readme/Plan.png)

The origional intention was for the profile section, posts and reccomendations (future feature) to all be on the same page. Upon review this would have been overloading the page a bit.

![Home page wireframe](/static/images/readme/Home.png)

After reassessing that set up I created another wireframe for the profile page - the final structure of this is slightly differnt in that the two sections are stacked horizontally not vertically.

![Profile wireframe](/static/images/readme/Profile.png)

Next we have the navbar and footer - the end product of both turned out nearly the same as the wireframe with just the filter function seperated from the navbar since it wouldn't be relevant for all pages.

# Agile Development

For the development of Sojourn Scribbles, I adopted an Agile methodology to ensure iterative and efficient progress throughout the project lifecycle. Central to this approach was the utilization of a Kanban board hosted on GitHub Projects.

## Kanban Board Overview

The Kanban board served as a visual representation of the project's progress and allowed for effective task management. It consisted of the following sections:

- **Backlog:** This section contained all the tasks and user stories that were yet to be prioritized for implementation.
- **Ready:** Tasks and user stories ready for development were moved to this column.
- **In Progress:** Work in progress was tracked here, indicating tasks actively being worked on.
- **In Review:** Upon completion, tasks were moved here for review before being marked as done.
- **Done:** Tasks that were completed successfully were moved to this column.
- **Future Features:** Ideas and tasks earmarked for future development were kept in this section for consideration in subsequent iterations.

### User Stories Integration

User stories played a pivotal role in shaping the development process, ensuring that features were aligned with user needs. These user stories were mapped onto the Kanban board, guiding the prioritization and implementation of tasks. 

### Task Management

In addition to tracking user stories, the Kanban board served as a comprehensive task list. I utilized it to break down user stories into smaller, actionable tasks, ensuring clear and manageable objectives for development. This granular approach facilitated efficient progress tracking and enhanced team collaboration.

By leveraging Agile principles and utilizing the Kanban board effectively, the development of Sojourn Scribbles remained focused, adaptable, and responsive to evolving requirements, resulting in a more robust and user-centric Django blog application.

# Testing and Validation

## Responsiveness

## Testing and Validation
- I used the [W3 HTML Validator](https://validator.w3.org/#validate_by_input+with_options) to check the HTML on each of my site pages by Direct Input. I have resolved the necessary errors (extra </div> tags and correcting how width is set in an img tag). *However* there are some error messages remaning which are due to the content being created using Django Summernote editor in the admin panel.  
  
- I used the [W3 CSS Validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/#validate_by_input) to check my CSS script by Direct Input. I found no errors! There are 5 warnigns which are just flagging vendor extensions.

![CSS validation results](/static/images/readme/css.png)  
  
- I used the [CI Python Linter](https://pep8ci.herokuapp.com/) to check all my python scripts. I found a few small errors like the below - mostly lines were too long or there was a missing blank space line. I have left some of the error messages as they are related to a too long line at the result of a comment.

![Python Linter Result](/static/images/readme/linter.png)

- I also used the Django automated testing within my Gitpod workspace.

# Known Bugs

- **There is a bug with alert message in the profiles view.**  
The error message for the PostForm is not working as expected BUT thanks to the power of Django the user still receives red error messages within the form itself.  
The ProfilesForm success message was incorrectly displaying when there was an error submitting the PostForm. To avoid confusion for the user, until the bug is resolved I have turned off that alert message.  
  
![Alert message error](/static/images/readme/ealert.png)


- **There is a bug with handling input from Django Summernote to the Profile Form.**
 If you fill in the Profile Form from the admin panel the output is rendered with all of the coding tags visible and not formatted.  
 Thanks to Django, the users don't have access to the admin panel and can only create their profile from the form on the website so it is not posssible for them to experience this bug!
 ![Summernote Error](/static/images/readme/esummernote.png)

 - **There is a bug with the favicon site.webmanifest file**
 The below console error messages are related to the site.webmanifest file for my favicon. I tested removing the link to this file at the top of my base.html and the console was free of erros. However, based on some research I have decided to leave the file in because it's crucial for Progressive Web Apps (PWAs), providing essential metadata such as the application's name, icons, theme colors, and display mode to browsers. However, potential bugs or unexpected behavior may arise due to syntax errors, misconfigurations, or conflicts with other components. Acknowledging these issues emphasizes my commitment to resolving them, ensuring the application meets PWA standards and delivers an optimal user experience.
 ![site.webmanifest console error](/static/images/readme/ewebmanifest.png)

 - **There is a bug with image handling on the Profile page**
 I have a field to upload a profile image on the profile form, however there is a conflict with jQuery and my profile.js file. This conflict results in breaking the image handling - it does not display on the profile page nor is it uploaded to cloudinary.  
 I tried my best to resolve this issue but unfortunately it was not possible within the given time contraints based on the relative importance of the feature.  
 Some things I tired:  
  -- using jQuery no conflict var in different ways  
  -- loading the jQuery script in profile.js, base.html and profiles.html  
  -- restructuring the JS file  
  To avoid causing confusion for the user, I made the decision to remove the image upload field from the Profile form. The impact of this is that the user cannot customize their profile photo. Although the action is available in the admin panel so if the user is especially eager they can use the handly contact form to provide a link to their image!
